        <p>The state of accessibility on the web is abysmal. Of the top 1,000,000 websites, each page has <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#errors">an average of 57 accessibility defects having a notable impact on disabled end users</a>. Your website or web application probably presents barriers to your disabled clients and users.</p>
        <p>Good news: You can fix that!</p>
        <p>Fixing accessibility for your digital products will require work, and a shift in organization culture. It is not easy, and it doesn't happen overnight. Let me help you on your journey!</p>

                    <blockquote>Before Nic’s talk, I’d been aware of a few tools out there for increasing accessibility of your web applications, but it quickly became apparent that I’d barely scratched the surface. Excellent talk. I appreciated how he balanced detail with pointing attendees to references and resources to further their own understanding later. He has an easygoing, amiable presentation-style. </blockquote>

Nic brought many things to my attention that I had not thought of before and moving forward I feel this session will improve my coding and accessibility practices dramatically.</blockquote>
