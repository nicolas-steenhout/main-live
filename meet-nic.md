## Working with Nic 

<div class="flex-reflow">
  <div>
    <h3>I excel at</h3>
    <p>I'll simplify complex topics and explain them in ways that are easier to digest. I use concrete examples and lived stories to illustrate concepts that are sometimes intangible and harder to grasp.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h3>My motivations</h3>
    <p>I love working with motivated teams. Curiosity and a desire to learn is key here - because there is a lot to learn about accessibility. It's a great reward for me to see that metaphorical lightbulb turn on in your head after I explained something and it made you go "Ah ha! I get it now.".</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>The thin line</h3>
    <p>There's a thin line between not doing enough and working within a system's limitation. I'll help you stay accountable. I'll do it with grace and respect because I understand your limitations.</p>

<h2>My journey to today</h2>

<p>I was working on accessibility in the build environment in the early 1990's. I was also experimenting with building websites. In the space of 3 weeks, 3 colleagues came to me with web accessibility problems they were facing.</p>
<ol>
    <li>One was blind and couldn't understand the page they were visiting because the site used images of text instead of text in the main menu.</li>
    <li>One was deaf and couldn't access the information to setup up their new printer because the instructions came on a CD with a video without captions.</li>
    <li>One had ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and was unable to use any web page because of all the colors and size differences, and animations.</li>
    </ol>
<div class="container callout">
<p>It was a "eureka" moment for me. It was the point where everything clicked. Accessibility to digital environments was as important as accessibility in the built environment.</p>
</div>

<p>In the years since, I continued to grow my knowledge about digital accessibility. I worked on Open Source software to help improve accessibility. I discussed accessibility with <strong>a lot</strong> of disabled individuals. I advised non-profits and tertiary education providers. I consulted with local, state, and federal government organizations in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Belgium. I guided corporations towards building an internal culture of accessibility that allows them to build accessible products with less friction than they faced originally. I worked on the Web Content Accessibility Standard Education and Outreach team.</p>

<p>And throughout all that, I trained teams about accessibility. I spoke at conferences, small and large, about web accessibility. I gave keynote presentations about digital accessibility, and inclusion. Which I continue to do to this day!</p>

  <h2>Meet my colleague, Winston</h2>

  <div class="grid-reflow">
    <div>
      <p>Winston is my colleague, friend, and companion. Winston is my service dog and you won't often see one without the other.</p>
      <p>Winston is fully trained and has three main tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pulling my wheelchair</li>
        <li>Retrieving objects on command</li>
        <li>Helping with transfers</li>
      </ul>

## When I'm not working in accessibility...

<div class="flex-reflow">
  <div>
    <h3>Bird watching</h3>
    <p>In my down time, I escapes to nature as often as weather permits. I love bird watching and taking photos of birds.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Quilting</h3>
    <p>When the weather isn't conducive to going bird watching, I enjoy creating patchwork quilts.</p>
    <img src="/img/heart-quilt.jpg" alt="A 60 inch square quilt on the lawn. The quilt has a dark purple background and a patchwork heart shape occupies nearly the entirety of the quilt. The fabrics for the heart are a riot of Kaffe Fassett fabrics in reds, oranges, blues, yellows, and greens. The bottom right of the quilt is folded over showing a teal printed backing">
