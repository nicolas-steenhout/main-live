## Keynotes - In-Person or virtual workshops

<div class="grid-reflow">
    <div>
        <p>Most companies have a problem that isn't quite on their radar: Accessible products. </p>

<p>Or rather, they aren't building accessible websites, applications and documents. They don't realize how much of a problem it is for them. And for the up to 25% of their target audience. Because approximately 1 in 4 adults have a disability.</p>

<p>I'm on a mission! I'm here to guide your company make more products that are more accessible. And to do it in such a way that is less painful. </p>

<p>I am not a "motivational speaker", but I will motivate you and your teams. </p>

<h2>Keynote and presentation topics</h2>
    <p>Presentations that help your organization and teams understand and implement accessibility.</p>
    <p>I can also create a bespoke presentation for your organization.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Building a network of champions</strong> - As long as we treat accessibility as "projects to complete", we're always going to be on the back foot. We build a culture of accessibility by building a network of champion. Once we have a culture of accessibility, it's a bit as if accessibility is part of our organizational DNA. It's just part of what we do.</li>
    <li><strong>The evolution of assistive technologies</strong> - Assistive technologies, or tools, devices, and software that help disabled people, often get adopted by the public at large, making all our lives easier. And then get refined for further use by disabled folks. It's a healthy cycle. </li>
    <li><strong>Introduction to digital accessibility</strong> - Filled with real life example, this talk introduces the concepts of what is digital accessibility and why it's so important.</li>
    <li><strong>ARIA 101</strong> - An introduction to the Accessible Rich Internet Application standard, and how to use it to improve accessibility.</li>
    </ul>

        <figure>
            <blockquote>Really great talk that left me mildly horrified about my own sites as I could immediately think of examples where I had been unknowingly doing things wrong. Nic brought many things to my attention that I had not thought of before and moving forward I feel this session will improve my coding and accessibility practices dramatically.</blockquote>

            <blockquote>Nic broadened my understanding of what it means for something have a “barrier.” Accessibility matters to a lot more people and in a lot more ways than I had previously realized. He provided plenty of examples of what to do about it, as well as further avenues for investigation.</blockquote>
